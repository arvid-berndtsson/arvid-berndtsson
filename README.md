# Hi, I'm Arvid 👋

Developer with one foot in cybersecurity, the other in automation – and occasionally both stuck in DevOps. I like building things that work (ideally without too many manual steps), and I spend a bit too much time debugging my own tooling.

- 🍋‍🟩 Founder of [LimeTip](https://limetip.com) – EU VAT made API-shaped
- 🌱 Co-founder of [Merely Emissions](https://merelyemissions.com) – Digital Carbon Footprint Calculator
- 📍 Based in Malmö, Sweden
